# Build Status Summary

## Current Situation

### ❌ Local Build (JDK 21 Incompatibility)
The local build environment has JDK 21 which is **incompatible** with the current Android Gradle Plugin version. The specific error:

```
Execution failed for task ':app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':app:androidJdkImage'.
   > Failed to transform core-for-system-modules.jar
   > Error while executing process jlink.exe
```

### ✅ GitHub Actions Build (Should Work)
We've set up GitHub Actions with:
- JDK 17 (compatible version)
- Android SDK setup
- Fixed build.gradle syntax errors
- KSP migration (replacing kapt)

## Next Steps

### ✅ Completed Fixes:
1. Fixed corrupted `app/build.gradle` syntax
2. Updated `gradle.properties` with compatibility settings  
3. Created two GitHub workflows:
   - `android-build-fixed.yml` (comprehensive)
   - `simple-build.yml` (streamlined)
4. Pushed changes to trigger automated builds

### 🔄 Check GitHub Actions:
Visit: https://github.com/Rahexa/parental-control-monitor/actions

The build should:
1. Use JDK 17 (compatible with Android tools)
2. Build the APK successfully 
3. Upload APK as downloadable artifact

### 📱 APK Download:
Once the GitHub Actions build completes:
1. Go to the completed workflow run
2. Scroll to "Artifacts" section
3. Download `parental-control-app.zip`
4. Extract to get the APK file

## Local Development Options:
1. **Install JDK 17** alongside JDK 21
2. **Use Android Studio's embedded JDK 17** (if available)
3. **Continue using GitHub Actions** for builds (recommended)

## Files Ready for Installation:
- All code syntax errors fixed
- Dependencies properly configured
- Build scripts optimized for CI/CD

The parental control app should build successfully in the GitHub Actions environment!
